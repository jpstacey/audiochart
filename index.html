<p id="intro">
Allows the user to explore charts on web pages using sound and the keyboard rather than, or in conjunction with, visually and with the mouse.  The code is <a href="https://github.com/matatk/audiochart">hosted on GitHub</a> and can easily be added to any page containing charts (or HTML tables or JSON data).  A <a href="hello-world-tutorial.html">tutorial</a> and <a href="examples-gallery.html">examples</a> are available.

	Thanks to <a href="http://paciellogroup.com">The Paciello Group</a> for allowing me to share this with you, and to <a href="http://sonification.de/handbook/">The Sonification Handbook</a> for the research behind it.

	<p>
	AudioChart uses the Web Audio API, which has <a href="http://caniuse.com/audio-api">great support amongst browsers, including Microsoft Edge</a>, though is not (yet) supported by Internet Explorer.
	</p>

	<h2>What does it do for you?</h2>
	<p>
	It augments charts you may already have on your page (or those that you create) with sounds that represent the data in the chart.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Supports charts made with Google Charts API as well as JSON structures and HTML tables.</li>
		<li>Can highlight the data visually on the chart during playback (Google Charts only).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	More information (including planned work) can be found <a href="https://github.com/matatk/audiochart#audiochart">in the README</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>Tutorial and Examples</h2>
	<p>
	The <a href="examples-gallery.html">Examples Gallery</a> contains line and bar Google Charts, JSON- and HTML table-based examples.	Steps to create the <a href="hello-world-tutorial.html">Google Charts-based "Hello, world" example</a> are described in the <a href="https://github.com/matatk/audiochart#audiochart">README</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>Testing and known bugs</h2>
	<p>
	You can <a href="test/">run the unit tests in-browser</a> or via the command line if you have <code>jasmine-node</code> installed.
	</p>
	<p>
	Sometimes, if you hear no audio when trying to play one of the examples, you have to reload the page (because the audio context gets locked up).  This is probably down to my code not clearing up properly.
